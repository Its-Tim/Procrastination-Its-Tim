      <h3><li>Set deadlines</li></h3>
        <p>Deadlines are a good way to help with your time management as it gives you a set time to complete your task.</p>

      <h3><li>Reward yourself</li></h3>
        <p>Always reward yourself. This can help motivate you to want to complete more tasks. 2 ways to reward yourself are either with a break or maybe social media time.</p>

      <h3><li>Practice self-compassion</li></h3>
          <p>Treat yourself with kindness, and acceptance, especially when struggling with your tasks, rather than self-criticism.</p>

      <h3><li>Establish accountability</li></h3>
          <p>Take responsibility for your actions and ensure you follow through on tasks to complete your goals. Also, understand yourself better and develop self-awareness that leads to greater succession in life.</p>

          <h3><li>Adjust your environment</li></h3>      <p>Create yourself a spot and setting to which minimizes distractions, making it easier to concentrate and complete tasks.</p>

      <h3><li>Change your mindset</li></h3>
          <p>Changing your mindset means to view tasks as opportunites for growth and achievements instead of overwhelming.</p>

      <h3><li>Be kind to yourself</li></h3>
          <p>This is basically the same as #8 Practice self-compassion, but this is more towards treating yourself with the same gentleness you would offer a friend facing a similar task.</p>

      <h3><li>Prioritize important tasks</li></h3>
        <p>Another very important step, as doing lesser tasks or tasks that isn't as important can delay your succession.</p>
